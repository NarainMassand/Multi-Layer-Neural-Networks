Auto-Encoder

Reconstruction of MNIST data set using Back propagation algorithm    
Number of neurons in input layer = Number of neurons in output layer
The hidden layer is trained to reconstruct numbers and then tested to check the accuracy of reconstruction
All code written in MATLAB and is compatible with all versions after 2012

autoencoder.m - Reconstruction done using 1 hidden layer
sigmoid.m - Activation function used in the algorithm

Confusionmatrixtrain.m - Function to generate a confusion matrix depending on training data set
Conftest.m - Function to generate a confusion matrix depending on test results

All other graphs are based on different multiple trials and the features displayed were judged best by the developer
