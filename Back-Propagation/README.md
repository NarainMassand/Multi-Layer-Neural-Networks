Back-Propagation

Classification of MNIST data set using Back propagation algorithm   
All code written in MATLAB and is compatible with all versions after 2012

bppalmostdone.m - Classification done using 1 hidden layer   
multilayerbpp.m - Classification done using multiple hidden layers depending on user   
sigmoid.m - Activation function used in the algorithm   

Confusionmatrixtrain.m - Function to generate a confusion matrix depending on training data set     
Conftest.m - Function to generate a confusion matrix depending on test results   

Bar graph shows the respective classification error on each digit on training and testing   

All other graphs are based on different multiple trials and the features displayed were judged best by the developer
